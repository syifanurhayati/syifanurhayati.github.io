Data Structures and Algorithms course focus on foundational concepts such as algorithm analysis (time complexity), abstract data types and collections, and recursion. The course covers a range of sorting algorithms (including bubble, selection, insertion, shell, merge, and quick sort), as well as key data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and various types of trees (binary search trees, AVL trees, and B-trees), along with binary heaps. Students learn to analyze, implement, and apply these structures and algorithms in problem-solving. (Fall 2024, Fall 2025)
